        "output": " The correct answer is (C): Both are caused by cooling.\n\nShaking up salad dressing and beating an egg are both examples of physical changes, specifically changes in the state of the mixture. When you shake up salad dressing, the ingredients are mixed together, but the components of the dressing do not fundamentally change. Similarly, when you beat an egg, the proteins in the egg white are denatured and rearranged, but the egg remains an egg. Both of these processes involve cooling the mixture, which causes the molecules to slow down and settle into a more ordered arrangement.",
