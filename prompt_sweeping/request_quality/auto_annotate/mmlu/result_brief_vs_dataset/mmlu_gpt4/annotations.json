On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

Considering those principles, is the trial court likly to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge?\n(A): Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts.\n(B): Yes, because the fish would have to be delivered to the buyer and payment received from him for there to be a completed attempt.\n(C): No, because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal attempt to allow the case to go to the jury.\n(D): No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime.",

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n(A): The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(B): The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n(C): The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(D): The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.",

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\n(A): Salvation\n(B): Predestination\n(C): Divinity of Jesus\n(D): Simony",

Specifically, for C \u2283 (D \u2228 C), if C is true, then D \u2228 C must be true (since C implies D \u2228 C), and for C \u00b7 ~D, if C is true, then ~D must be true (since C implies ~D). Therefore, these two propositions are logically equivalent.\n\n(B) Contradictory: The truth tables show that these two propositions are never both true. For instance, if C is true, then ~D must be false (since C implies D \u2228 C), and if C is false, then D \u2228 C must be false (since C is false). Therefore, these two propositions are contradictory.\n\n(C) Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent: The truth tables show that these two propositions are not always either true or false. For instance, if C is false, then both C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D must be false. However, this does not imply that the two propositions are contradictory, since they can both be false even if C is false. Therefore, these two propositions are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\n(D) Inconsistent: The truth tables show that one of the propositions is always false when the other proposition is true. Specifically, if C is true, then ~D must be false, but if C is false, then D \u2228 C must be true. Therefore, these two propositions are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, based on the truth tables, we can conclude that:\n\n* C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are logically equivalent (A)\n* C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are contradictory (B)\n* C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent (C)\n* C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are inconsistent (D)",

    "instruction":"A landlord owned a three-story home in fee simple and leased it to his friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably\n(A): recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.\n(B): recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.\n(C): not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\n(D): not recover, because the professor remains liable.",

The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves.

When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nThe Spanish in America were interested in which of the following?\n(A): Escaping oppression at home\n(B): Expanding territories under Spanish control\n(C): Seeking religious freedom for themselves\n(D): Creating independent principalities for themselves",

    "instruction":"This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n(A): observation and induction\n(B): ancient textual authority\n(C): experimentation\n(D): deduction from first principles",

And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?\n(A): Emerging systems of coerced labor\n(B): The expansion of chattel slavery\n(C): Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces\n(D): Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies",

    "instruction":"This question refers to the following information.\nThe pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.\nSource 1\nIndians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?\n(A): Converting the natives to Christianity\n(B): Financial gain\n(C): Personal glory\n(D): Finding new mates",

The passage states that the Spanish are killing and destroying the indigenous population solely for the purpose of acquiring gold and riches, and that their ultimate aim is to swell themselves with wealth. This suggests that financial gain is a major motivator for the Spanish explorers and that de las Casas views it as the primary driving force behind their actions.",

This means that there is a 1% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (that the two drugs are the same in terms of effectiveness) when it is true.\n\nTo calculate the statistical power, we can use the following formula:\n\nPower = (\u0394BP \/ SE)\u00b2 \u00d7 (1-\u03b1)\n\nwhere SE is the standard error of the difference in blood pressure between the two treatments, and \u03b1 is the level of significance (i.e., the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true).\n\nSince we don't have information about the standard error, we can use a rough estimate of 10 mm Hg, which is approximately the standard error of blood pressure measurements.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPower = ((\u0394BP \/ 10)\u00b2 \u00d7 (1-0.01)) = (40 \/ 10)\u00b2 \u00d7 0.99 = 0.4\n\nSo the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is approximately 40%.",

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n(A): Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B): Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C): No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D): No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",

Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. \" The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:\"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. \"When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
