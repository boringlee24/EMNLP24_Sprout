        "output": " A statement made in exaggerated terms is called an hyperbole. An hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker or writer makes an statement that is intentionally overstated or exaggerated in order to emphasize a point, express strong emotions, or create a comical effect.\n\nHyperbole is often used to add emphasis or create a strong impression. For example, if someone says \"I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant,\" they are using hyperbole to express their extreme hunger, even though it's unlikely they could actually eat an entire elephant.\n\nHyperbole can also be used to make a point more memorable or to grab attention. For instance, a politician might say \"We need to fix this problem now, or the consequences will be catastrophic!\" to emphasize the urgency of the situation.\n\nIt's important to note that hyperbole is not meant to be taken literally, and listeners or readers should be able to tell that the statement is exaggerated. Over time, the use of hyperbole can become habitual, and people may start to use it in everyday conversation to add emphasis or humor.",
