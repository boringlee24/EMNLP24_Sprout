        "output": " A statement made in exaggerated terms is called an hyperbole. An hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker or writer makes an statement that is intentionally overstated or exaggerated in order to emphasize a point, express strong emotions, or create a comical effect.\n\nHyperbole is often used to add emphasis or create a strong impression. For example, if someone says \"I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant,\" they are using hyperbole to express their extreme hunger, even though it's unlikely they could actually eat an entire elephant.\n\nHyperbole can also be used to make a point more memorable or to grab attention. For instance, a politician might say \"We need to fix this problem now, or the consequences will be catastrophic!\" to emphasize the urgency of the situation.\n\nIt's important to note that hyperbole is not meant to be taken literally, and listeners or readers should be able to tell that the statement is exaggerated. Over time, the use of hyperbole can become habitual, and people may start to use it in everyday conversation to add emphasis or humor.",

Some common places where you might find brackish water include:\n\n1. Estuaries: These are areas where rivers meet the ocean, and the mixing of freshwater and saltwater creates a brackish environment. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay, the Amazon Estuary, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n2. Coastal wetlands: Areas like mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and sea grass beds are often brackish environments.\n3. Lagoons: Some lagoons, such as those found in the tropics, are brackish water bodies that are separated from the ocean by barrier islands or other landforms.\n4. Desert oases: In some deserts, such as the Sahara and the Mojave, brackish water can be found in oases and other wetland areas.\n5. Brackish aquifers: These are underground layers of rock that contain brackish water. They can be found in coastal areas and other regions where there is a mix of freshwater and saltwater.\n6. Seawater desalination plants: These plants use reverse osmosis or other technologies to remove salt and other minerals from seawater, producing brackish water as a byproduct.\n7. Brackish lakes: Some lakes, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Great Victoria Desert in Australia, are brackish water bodies that are isolated from the ocean and have a unique ecosystem.\n8. Industrial wastewater: Some industrial processes, such as paper mills and salt mines, can produce brackish water as a byproduct.\n\nThese are just a few examples of where you might find brackish water.

For example, a score of 15 or 16 is considered a very good round of golf, and scores of 13 or 14 are considered exceptional.\n\nIn professional golf, the lowest score ever recorded in a competition is 58, shot by Roger Bannister at the 1954 The Open Championship.

Some of these characteristics include:\n\n1. Tagging genes: Researchers often use genetic markers, such as fluorescent proteins, to tag the genes they have modified. These markers allow them to visualize the expression of the modified gene and confirm its presence in the GM animal.\n2. Colored fur: Some GM animals have been engineered to have a distinctive colored fur, such as a yellow or green tint, which can be used to identify them as GM.\n3. Increased or decreased size: GM animals may be larger or smaller than their non-GM counterparts, depending on the genetic modification. For example, GM mice with a growth hormone gene insertion may be larger than non-GM mice.\n4. Abnormalities in physical characteristics: GM animals may exhibit abnormalities in their physical characteristics, such as extra limbs or organs, which can be used to identify them as GM.\n5. Altered behavior: GM animals may exhibit altered behavior, such as increased aggression or anxiety, which can be used to identify them as GM.\n6. Glowing or glowing eyes: Some GM animals have been engineered to produce a glowing proteins that can be used to identify them as GM.\n7. Genetic testing: Researchers can use genetic testing methods such as PCR, Southern blot, and DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of genetic modification.\n8. Blood test: Some GM animals may have a specific blood test that can identify the presence of the genetic modification.\n9. Physiological changes: GM animals may exhibit physiological changes, such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or metabolism, which can be used to identify them as GM.\n10. Imaging techniques: Researchers can use imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, or PET to visualize the expression of the genetic modification in the GM animal.\n\nIt's worth noting that the characteristics used to identify GM animals may vary depending on the type of genetic modification and the research question being addressed. Additionally, not all GM animals will exhibit obvious characteristics, and some may have subtle changes that can only be detected through laboratory testing.",
