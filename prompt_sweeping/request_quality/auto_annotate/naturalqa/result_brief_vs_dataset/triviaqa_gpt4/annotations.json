    "output_2":" The origins of the nursery rhyme \"Ring Around the Rosie\" are unclear and have been the subject of much debate and speculation. One theory is that the rhyme originated in the 14th century, during the Black Death, a pandemic that spread across Europe and killed millions of people. According to this theory, the lines of the rhyme are interpreted as follows:\n\n* \"Ring around the rosie\" refers to the red rash that appeared on the skin of those infected with the plague.\n* \"A pocket full of posies\" refers to the practice of carrying flowers and herbs, such as lavender, which were believed to ward off the disease.\n* \"Ashes, ashes\" refers to the cremation of the dead, which was a common practice during the plague due to the rapid spread of the disease and the lack of space for burials.\n\nHowever, this theory is not universally accepted, and the true origins of the rhyme remain a mystery.",
