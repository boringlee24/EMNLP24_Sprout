After the September 11 attacks (2001): President George W.

Some of the key figures associated with the theory include:\n\n1. Carl von Clausewitz: A 19th-century Prussian philosopher and military strategist, Clausewitz is best known for his work \"On War,\" which emphasizes the importance of leadership and the role of chance in military success.\n\n2. Thomas Carlyle: A Scottish philosopher and historian, Carlyle is often credited with coining the phrase \"Great Man Theory\" in his 1840 essay \"Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History.\" He argued that history is shaped by the actions of extraordinary individuals, rather than by larger social or economic forces.\n\n3. Friedrich Nietzsche: A 19th-century German philosopher, Nietzsche rejected the idea of a single, universal \"Great Man\" theory, arguing instead that historical figures are complex, multi-dimensional individuals who cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.\n\n4. Robert K. Merton: An American sociologist, Merton introduced the concept of \"social structure\" to the study of leadership in the 1940s and 1950s. He argued that leaders emerge from and are shaped by the social structures in which they operate.\n\n5. Paul Lazarsfeld: An Austrian-American sociologist, Lazarsfeld developed the idea of \"leadership communication\" in the 1940s and 1950s, arguing that leaders influence followers through the strategic use of language and communication.\n\n6. James MacGregor Burns: An American historian and political scientist, Burns is best known for his work on transactional leadership, which emphasizes the role of negotiation and compromise in leadership. He developed the theory of \"transformational leadership\" in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n7. Warren Bennis: An American psychologist and leadership scholar, Bennis is known for his work on leadership styles and the role of leaders in organizations. He developed the concept of \"charismatic leadership\" in the 1950s and 1960s.",

In general, the federal government, state governments, and local governments all play a role in enforcing water quality standards. Here are some examples:\n* At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national water quality standards under the Clean Water Act. The EPA also provides funding and technical assistance to states to help them enforce these standards.\n* States are responsible for implementing and enforcing water quality standards within their borders. They may also have their own water quality standards that are more stringent than federal standards.\n* Local governments, such as cities and counties, are responsible for enforcing water quality standards in their municipal watersheds. They may also be responsible for operating and maintaining wastewater treatment plants and other infrastructure to protect water quality.\nOverall, the responsibility for enforcing water quality standards is typically shared among multiple levels of government, with each level playing a role in different aspects of the process.",
