According to this theory, the lines of the rhyme are interpreted as follows:\n\n* \"Ring around the rosie\" refers to the red rash that appeared on the skin of those infected with the plague.\n* \"A pocket full of posies\" refers to the practice of carrying flowers and herbs, such as lavender, which were believed to ward off the disease.\n* \"Ashes, ashes\" refers to the cremation of the dead, which was a common practice during the plague due to the rapid spread of the disease and the lack of space for burials.\n\nHowever, this theory is not universally accepted, and the true origins of the rhyme remain a mystery.",

However, this threshold can be as low as 20-30 ng/mL for more sensitive tests. It's important to note that the amount of THC present in a drug test can also depend on factors such as the potency of the THC, the method of consumption, and the individual's metabolism.",
