In 1863, pedals were added. A few years later, a new, lighter bike was developed that used a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. Called the \"Ariel,\" it became popular but was quite accident-prone. Over the next decade, \"safety\" bicycles were produced, incorporating welcome improvements such as air-filled rubber tires, brakes, and gears.
